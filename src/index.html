    <h1>Pure CSS LQIP Example</h1>
    <h2>LQIP: Low Quality Image Placeholder</h2>
    <p>
      The load time is too short to see the effect of the LQIP for local hosted
      images; but you can see what it would look like by hovering over the
      image.
    </p>
    <div style="--lqip: 435811">
      <img src="image.jpg" style="--lqip: 435811" />
    </div>
    <!-- the --lquip: code is what styles the image background during loading -->
    <!-- it needs to be generated by the script lqipCodes.js -->
    <!-- ideally it would be created on the fly and inserted into the html code from the server -->
